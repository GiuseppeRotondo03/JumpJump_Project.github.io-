# #Summary

this project has finally tested my ability to be able to work hours in a row and to be able to publish something finished and with optimized performance thanks to better programming techniques.

## #Specifications

    - 2 weeks ( 5h / day )
    - Parkur Game
    - Developed in Unreal Egine
    - Texures made in Quixel Mixer

## #Project goals

- Building a PC game with Unic gameplay
- Building a PC game with simple and effective design, to test and improve my skills as designer
- Building a PC game with complex technical structure under the surface, to test and improve my skills as a game programmer
- Building a PC game as optimized as possible, putting before design, after performance and than art

# #Game design
The game is inspired by games I played when I was younger like Minecraft Parkour, Crash Bandicoot and a little bit of titan fall 2. 
I love giving the player the chance to decide and I wanted to challenge myself with new things and I hate monotony, so I realized this idea:

## #Game Idea
The player finds himself on a hill (an island) surrounded by an infinite low land (an ocean) and must find a way to escape but if he touches the land, he dies. To avoid dying, he uses his gun to shoot and create obstacles for him to jump over with a fast and easy to control movement.


## #Unic Points

- The player decides where to go, not the game. The player creates rooms with different types of obstacles inside
- Each room may contain different obstacles from the previous room, so the player always faces new challenges
- The player evaluates whether or not to take debuffs to obtain other advantages such as a better position to jump

## #Rooms and obstacles

- type 1
- type 2
- type 3
- type 4
- type 5

## #movement

- Unreal Engine m
- my new movement 1
- my new movement 2

## #The issues and how i fixed it

## #debuff

## #score and quest
