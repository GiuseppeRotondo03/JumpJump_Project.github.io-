# #Summary
I'm a passionate game programmer with 2 years of experience in PC game programming with Unity 3D and Unreal Engine. I know C, C++ and other programming languages studied in my high school or by myself. Self-taught, honest, open minded, ready to listen to others when needed.


## #Project goals

    - Building a PC game with simple and effective design
    - Building a PC game with complex technical structure under the surface, testing my skills as a programmer
    - 

My goal was a game that would allow me to demonstrate my programming and also game design skills. To do so I knew my game couldn't be an OpenWorld or an- in FPS.  In short, I couldn't make the game that a Triple A studio can make in months -.
